# Running the code
It is recommended to install the book's code dependencies in a 
[conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html).

After cloning the repository to your local machine, you can install the dependencies
using the following command in your terminal:

    conda env create -f environment.yml

You can then activate the conda environment and start a [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)
instance using the following commands:

    conda activate pcrm-book
    jupyter lab

If you are completely new to [conda environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
and Jupyter notebooks, you can find a lot of information online.
