# Portfolio Construction and Risk Management book's Python code
This repository contains the accompanying code to Portfolio Construction and Risk
Management book © 2025 by Anton Vorobets. [You can find the latest PDF version of
the book in this Substack post](https://antonvorobets.substack.com/p/pcrm-book).

If you want to support this project and potentially get perks and recognition
for it, see the [crowdfunding campaign](https://igg.me/at/pcrm-book).

# Running the code
It is recommended to install the book's code dependencies in a 
[conda environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html).

After cloning the repository to your local machine, you can install the dependencies
using the following command in your terminal:

    conda env create -f environment.yml

You can then activate the conda environment and start a [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)
instance using the following commands:

    conda activate pcrm-book
    jupyter lab

If you are completely new to [conda environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
and Jupyter notebooks, you can find a lot of information online.

# Feedback
Please post your feedback in the community Discussions forum. I will try to
incorporate the feedback in the book. See the book's preface for some general
perspectives on what it tries to achieve, and which kind feedback will
be considered appropriate.

# Thank you for your support
Your support made it possible for this book to be written.

Besides your personal monetary support, you can help improve the quality of the
book by simply publicly sharing your positive experience with the book and its code,
thereby encouraging more people to support the project. You
are also encouraged to give this and the supporting
[fortitudo.tech](https://github.com/fortitudo-tech/fortitudo.tech)
repository a star.

No matter how much economic support this project realistically gets, it will only
be a small fraction of the opportunity costs from writing the book and making it
freely available online. Hence, you are encouraged to support it by the amount that
you think it is worth to you.

If you claim one of the significiant contributor perks, you can choose to be recognized
in the book's preface. You will additionally get a one-year paid complimentary Substack
subscription to the [Quantamental Investing publication](https://antonvorobets.substack.com),
which will contain exclusive case studies and allow you to continue asking questions.
